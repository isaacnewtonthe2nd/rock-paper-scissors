# rock-paper-scissors

11/09/2024
This project is a coding challenge from The Odin Project introductory Javascript. It is meant to demonstrate our knowledge of javascript thus far.
It entails create a game of rock paper scissors, and prompting a user to play the game with the computer. I was able to accomplish this using the concepts of functions, variable declarations, conditional statements, logic, problem solving, loops, and so on. So far, I can say this project is a success. All that is needed would just be to clean up my code a little bit more. I plan on revisiting this code and provide updates in this readMe file.
